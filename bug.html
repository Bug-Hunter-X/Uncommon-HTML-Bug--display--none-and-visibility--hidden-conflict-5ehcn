<body>
  <div id="myDiv">
    This text should be hidden initially.
  </div>

  <script>
    // Bug: Incorrect use of display: none and visibility: hidden
    document.getElementById("myDiv").style.display = "none";
    document.getElementById("myDiv").style.visibility = "hidden"; 

    // The intention is to initially hide the div, but the combination of display: none and visibility: hidden creates an unusual behavior
    //  where visibility: hidden may override display: none causing unexpected issues. (in this case, it might work as intended, but can cause issue in other situations)
